# Autonomous Car

## • This project aims to implement a self-driving Car that can avoid the obstacles with very fast response:

❑ Ultrasonic is placed on servo motor axis, its function to detect the obstacles on the car way.

❑ If the car found an obstacle, it must change its way according to the ultrasonic data.

## Component:

1. Ultrasonic HC- SR04.
2. Servo motor.
3. L293D.
4. Motors.
5. Caster wheel.
6. Chassis

## Specifications –ultrasonic Sensor, L293D, LCD, Servo:

1. Ultrasonic is used to detect any obstacles towards to the car, and the car must fast react to avoid this obstacle like stopping and turning to any empty direction.
2. L293D is used to control the speed and the direction of motors.
3. LCD displays the current direction that car immediately move.
4. Servo is used to make ultrasonic scanning around 180°.
